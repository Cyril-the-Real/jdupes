<!-- Certify that you've searched through Issues before adding yours. Failure to do this will result in immediate closure or deletion of your issue. -->
**Have you searched in Issues?**
[ ] I have searched for my problem in Issues and I am confident that this is not a duplicate of a previous reported issue or feature request.

**Certify that you're not posting about common non-issues**
[ ] I am not suggesting changing the hash algorithm, storing files in a database, comparing file data blocks differently, suggesting that file sizes should be used before comparison, or other common suggestions that indicate I haven't read the documentation, code, or examined the issue tracker entries to discover that all of these things have already been implemented or won't make a difference if they were implemented. I have done my due diligence before asking for help or making a suggestion.

<!-- Describe the issue you're having or feature you're requesting. Be as clear and detailed as possible. -->

blah blah blah, I didn't fill this out, please close my request
